✋ Hand Touch Detection System
📌 Project Overview

The Hand Touch Detection System is a computer vision–based project that detects hand movements and touch gestures in real time using a webcam.
It leverages OpenCV and Machine Learning / Deep Learning models to accurately identify hand regions and track touch interactions.

This project can be extended for applications such as:

Touchless interfaces

Gesture-based control systems

Smart surveillance

Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)

🚀 Features
