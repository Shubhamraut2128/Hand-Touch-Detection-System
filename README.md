# ✋ Hand Touch Detection System

## 📌 Project Description
The **Hand Touch Detection System** is a computer vision–based application that detects **hand movements and touch gestures in real time** using a webcam.  
It uses image processing and machine learning techniques to recognize hand regions and track interactions without physical contact.

This project demonstrates the practical use of **OpenCV and ML concepts** in real-world Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) systems.
